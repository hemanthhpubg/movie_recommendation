Overview:

This application offers movie recommendations tailored to user preferences. It leverages various techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to enhance the user experience.

Key Features:

Cosine Similarity for Movie Grouping: The application employs cosine similarity to group similar movies together, enhancing the recommendation system's accuracy.

Text Preprocessing: Before analysis, the raw data provided by the user undergoes text preprocessing to extract meaningful insights for better movie recommendations.

Custom NER Model: A custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model is developed using NLP techniques. It labels movie titles, cast members, and directors in user queries, improving query understanding.

SVM Intent Classifier: The application utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify user intent. This helps in understanding user requests more effectively and delivering appropriate movie recommendations.

How to Use:

Input Data: Users can input their preferences and queries regarding movies.

Processing: The application preprocesses the user's input to extract relevant information.

Recommendations: Using cosine similarity and user intent classification, the application provides personalized movie recommendations.
